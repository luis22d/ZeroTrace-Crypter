ZeroTrace is a powerful crypter for security research and testing.
Key Features

Next-gen obfuscation - Hides code using advanced techniques
Bypasses security solutions - Can evade detection by EDR/XDR systems
AI-powered - Uses artificial intelligence to make each output unique
Custom compiler - Not based on public compilers like CodeDOM or Roslyn
DLL randomization - Changes DLL signatures with each build
EXE modification - Alters executable structure to avoid detection
Hidden startup - Implements covert execution methods
Full file protection - Comprehensive security for your applications

Technical Advantage
ZeroTrace stands out by using proprietary methods instead of known public approaches. This makes it much harder to detect using standard signatures.



## Why Is It So Powerfull?
 it's integrated with AI, which updates & changes the stub whole time,  it's not using codedom or roslyn, that what's makes it unique too..
 it's using loadpe to load your payload, it does have parent spoof and all other stuff that makes it unique
 you can use your favorite software that can be njrat, nanocore, xworm, zerotrace stealer, and etc
 bypasses memory scans
 bypasses avast sandbox scan
 bypasses eset memory scan.
 bypasses chinese AV.



## Coded Lang C#
why is it coded in C#?  well because most peoples using .net  rats, stealers, grabbers and etc,  i can make native crypter but it won't support .net files, which is not great for most peoples.
